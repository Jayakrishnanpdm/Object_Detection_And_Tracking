# 🛡️ YOLO-Based Theft Detection System  

A deep learning-based security system that uses **YOLOv8** for real-time object detection to identify suspicious activities, such as unauthorized file pickups, in restricted areas (e.g., HR cabin, offices, malls).  

The system detects **people and objects (files)** using YOLO, tracks interactions, and sends **alerts** if any unauthorized person picks up a file.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Real-time **object detection** using YOLOv8  
✅ Detects **people & sensitive files** in camera footage  
✅ **Tracks people and objects** using DeepSORT (coming soon)  
✅ **Triggers alerts** if a non-authorized person picks up a file  
✅ Optional **email / Telegram notifications** to HR  
✅ Future scope: Face recognition for authorized person detection, action recognition, and full dashboard.
